# Final Project Proposal for MIS3640
## by Julia Chon, Dairaneara Haith, and Oorja Shah

### The Big Idea

Our goal in this project is to help Airbnb hosts in New York City predict how much they should charge customers based on neighborhood, type of room, reviews, ratings, and other metrics using Python to create a prediction model. 

At the minimum, we can create a prediction model using different Python modules and statements. We hope to create a variety of functions that will clean the data, run basic analytic formulas (average, median, linear relationships, etc), and then give a result of estimated prices based on the data used.

Our stretch goal is to create an interactive map of New York City with this data displayed in Python. This map will have the average price range per neighborhoods in New York city, mimicking a map of realtor house prices. 

### Learning Goals
##### Shared Goals: 
* Gain a better understanding of Python and the modules; specifically the scope of data analysis that can be used with it.
* Be able to effectively create functions within Python that reduces any redundancies and makes the code simple and easy to understand.
* Have strong collaboration within our team and efficiently utilize Github as a team work space.
* Work together (via pair programming) to preprocess the data in order to reduce errors and code as a team in order to solidify our coding skills.

##### Individual Goals: 
**Julia**: To have a data modeling/data analytics project to put on my resume.

**Oorja**:  Learn something new and improve on my Python programming skills. To have fun working with my team!  

**Deedee**: Grow my programming skill set to the point where I can work and experiment with Python on my own. 

### Implementation Plan

Dataset: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1aE3zH18fX0LhseASGiZjISi7QnPQzLP1AcZ6Gbj63l4/edit?usp=sharing

Source: http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html → This is a dataset from Airbnb that includes information about their hosts, property, price, reviews, among other key metrics.

1. Clean the data set → Remove unnecessary columns, fill or remove the blank data, check outliers, convert data types etc.
2. Look into best practices and machine learning methods → See which model is the most accurate
3. Create prediction model → use the selected variables (neighborhoods, ratings, room type) to predict an estimated price 
4. Check model
5. Create map using data → an interactive map the shows average price ranges for areas in the city 
6. Finish

### Collaboration Plan

We plan to work on this project together (through pair programming) in order to reduce the errors as the navigator would always be providing suggestions and helping correct mistakes. We will change the drivers and navigators throughout the course of eight weeks. 

Since we’re all in different timezones, we might split tasks up and complete them independently and then integrate. When integrating, we will go through the code together in order to eliminate the errors. 

### Risks

Since we are all Python beginners, one of the potential risks whilst working on this project could be the scope of knowledge about Python. We may not be as thorough with our Python programming skills.

Another risk could be the scope of what Python can do and if we spend too much time trying to create something that won’t work rather than moving on to a different way that works. 

### Additional Course Content

We think that it would be helpful to learn about predictive modeling in Python, and how to create dashboards and interactive visualizations (ie: maps, graphs, charts, etc.)
